A simple Clojure project that asks quick questions like "How does Lady Gaga in the WC look like?".

Use maven for compiling it. Load oracle.clj in the REPL, and ask a question. Actually, you can only ask one kind of question as of today: "How does ... look like?". But it can be a lot of fun anyway!

	(ask "How does Lady Gaga in the WC look like?")

Note: This will pop-up the answer using "google-chrome" so you should have it in the path.
